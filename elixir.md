### [Metaprogramming Elixir Write Less Code, Get More Done (and Have Fun!)](https://pragprog.com/titles/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir/)
Write code that writes code with Elixir macros. Macros make
metaprogramming possible and define the language itself. In this book,
you’ll learn how to use macros to extend the language with fast,
maintainable code and share functionality in ways you never thought
possible. You’ll discover how to extend Elixir with your own
first-class features, optimize performance, and create domain-specific
languages.

|---------------|---|
| **Purpose**   | Teach the very basics of metaprogramming all the way to writing your own language features and custom libraries  |
|---------------|---|
| **Takeaways** | - Understanding the basics of Elixir’s metaprogramming system with macros and the abstract syntax tree  |
                  - Extending Elixir with your own first-class features
                  - Properly testing your metaprogramming-based code
                  - Using metaprogramming responsibly and avoiding pitfalls
                  - Quickly master the ins and outs and be ready to start writing robust libraries
|---------------|---|
| **Target**    | Elixir programmer who has passed the basics and is ready to take his or her skills to the next level |
|---------------|---|
| **Format**    | Book (paper / digital)                                                                                                         |

### [Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir Find Bugs Before Your Users Do ](https://pragprog.com/titles/fhproper/property-based-testing-with-proper-erlang-and-elixir/)
Property-based testing helps you create better, more solid tests with
little code. By using the PropEr framework in both Erlang and Elixir,
this book teaches you how to automatically generate test cases, test
stateful programs, and change how you design your software for more
principled and reliable approaches. You will be able to better explore
the problem space, validate the assumptions you make when coming up
with program behavior, and expose unexpected weaknesses in your
design. PropEr will even show you how to reproduce the bugs it
found. With this book, you will be writing efficient property-based
tests in no time.

|---------------|---|
| **Purpose**   | Make confident enough to use the most advanced features of PropEr and basic understanding of property-based testing  |
|---------------|---|
| **Takeaways** | - Understanding the basic and foundational principles of property-based testing  |
                  - How property-based testing can be used in a realistic project
                  - How to write properties for checking implementation correctness
