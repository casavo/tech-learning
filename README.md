# Casavo Tech Learning

In this repo you can find a curated list of learning resources and learn paths. 

These are the same resources we use in Casavo as part of our continuous improvement approach.

## Tech Radar
At Casavo, we maintain a public tech radar to help our engineering teams align on technology choices.

It is based on the [pioneering work by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and the refinement by Zalando.

You can find it [here](https://techradar.casavo.com/)!
