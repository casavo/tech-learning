## What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. These algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data. It is seen as a subset of Artificial Intelligence.

## How can I classify machine learning approaches?

At the moment doesn't exists a clear classification working for any machine learning approach. Anyway, some partial classification arised.

Approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories: **Supervised Learning** (you know the desired output), **Unsupervised Learning** (you don't know or you know a little about the desired output) and Reinforcement Learning (you learn from the environment). Some of the approaches don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation.

Another classification compares "traditional" approaches, based mostly on statistics and optimization techniques, and Deep Learning, which has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work, based on Neural Networks. The main difference is the importance of the feature engineering phase. Traditional methods requires a lot of effort to find the best shape of the features. Deep Learning instead, just requires a huge amount of data.

Another classification is based on the field of use. Specializations are emerging to deal with specific problems: Predictive Analytics, Service Personalization, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition and many more.
